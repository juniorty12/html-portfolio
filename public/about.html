<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Before I found that i love coding, I was into healthcare. <br />
  I worked as a registered nurse for years and in the process of working,I  studied health science to beef up my knownledge in health.<br />
   However i never knew that coding is something i love doing when it comes to information technology. So, I  never look back.</p>

<p>Coding has been my hobby and every now and then i have been creating projects. Some of these projects you will find in this websites.I am still creating more projects which will be uploaded in this website later.</p>

<p>This is what i love to do, it is like my new find love. I would like to work in every area of society to solve problems that meets their needs.
